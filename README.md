# Python-OOP-s-Programming
Python is a cross-platform programming language, meaning, it runs on multiple platforms like Windows, MacOS, Linux and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free and open source.  Even though most of todayâ€™s Linux and Mac have Python preinstalled in it, the version might be out-of-date. So, it is always a good idea to install the most current version.


Introduction to OOPs in Python
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Meaning, it supports different programming approach.

One of the popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

An object has two characteristics:

attributes
behavior
Let's take an example:

Parrot is an object,

name, age, color are attributes
singing, dancing are behavior
The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

In Python, the concept of OOP follows some basic principles:

Inheritance	A process of using details from a new class without modifying existing class.
Encapsulation	Hiding the private details of a class from other objects.
Polymorphism	A concept of using common operation in different ways for different data input.
Class
A class is a blueprint for the object.

We can think of class as an sketch of a parrot with labels. It contains all the details about the name, colors, size etc. Based on these descriptions, we can study about the parrot. Here, parrot is an object.

The example for class of parrot can be :

class Parrot:
    pass
Here, we use class keyword to define an empty class Parrot. From class, we construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.

Object
An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.

The example for object of parrot class can be:

obj = Parrot()
Here, obj is object of class Parrot.

Suppose we have details of parrot. Now, we are going to show how to build the class and objects of parrot.
